# mViewer
This is a simple tool that generates images of the Mandlebrot Set in javascript, and allows some zooming.
It is still a work in progress!~)

Currently the image rendered is reminiscent of the Mandlebrot set, but differs from what I hope for. If anyone
can help me understand why it's not giving the right image, or wants to improve it, your help would be 
greatly appreciated!

Cheers!!!
